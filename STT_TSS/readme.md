## STT and TTS Chatbot on ChatGPT3

App takes text or audio (microphone) input and answers in text with audio.

* Need to set credentials/API to work properly as now it is using demo certificate which is not good.

* STT and TSS use IBM Watson.
* Dockerfile file most is not set correctly.
* This code is from IBM AI course https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-gen-ai-powered-applications/ungradedLti/z4OnT/lab-create-a-voice-assistant-with-openai-s-gpt-3-and-ibm-watson
